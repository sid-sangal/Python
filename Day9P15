1528. Shuffle String

Learning: copy question properly. which list/string to use in the loop. convert list to string. .join function to convert list to string.

My solution:

class Solution:
    def restoreString(self, s: str, indices: List[int]) -> str:
        new = [0]*len(s)
        out = ""
        temp = 0

        for i in indices:
    
            new[i] = s[temp]
            temp +=1
        for ele in new:
            out += ele
        return out
        
Better solution:

new = [none]*len(s)
for i in rnage (len(s)):
  new[indices[i]] = s[i]
return "".join(new)
