Problem: Jewels and stones

Learning: using the "+=" operator to increment the count of out and not "=" and more variables.

My solution:
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
        out=0
        for i in jewels:
            out += stones.count(i)
        return out
