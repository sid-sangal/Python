(imp) 1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order

Learning: The most interesting question till now with 2 major learnings. Usage of the for loop to traverse two separate lists simultaneously using two operators and the lists in zip format.
          Usage of the .insert function as opposed to the .extend and .append functions. The .insert function does not replace the element at the chosen index but right shifts it and 
My solution: I could not do it but now know how to using two methodds.

Solutions: Using the right shift .insert function and simultaneous traversal of two lists in zip format
 
 class Solution:
    def createTargetArray(self, nums, index):
        target = []
        for i,value in zip(index, nums):
            target.insert(i,value)
        return target

Other solution: without using any in-built functions:

class Solution:
    def createTargetArray(self, nums, index):
        target = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            target = target[:index[i]] + [nums[i]] + target[index[i]:]
        return target
