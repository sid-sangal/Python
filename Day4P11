problem: Goal Parser Interpretation

Learning: Idea was correct, to use .replace function. New learning is how to replace multiple elements of the string. using two .replace continuously.

My solution:
class Solution:
    def interpret(self, command: str) -> str:
             return command.replace('()','o').replace('(al)','al')
