1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

Learning: When to use while loop instead of for.

My solution:

class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps (self, num: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while num!= 0:
            if num%2 == 0:
                num = num/2
                count +=1
            else:
                num -=1
                count +=1
        return count
    
Better solution: One change being using one count increment operator outside the if-else condition instead of each. does not make a diff though. also //=2 syntax like the incrementand decrement operator.

class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps (self, num: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while num:
            if num%2 == 0:
                num //=2
            
            else:
                num -=1
            count +=1
        return count
