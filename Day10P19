1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

Learning: How to convert list to a set of tuples of length 2. The better solution takes the same time but more memory but teaches an interesting syntax of the for loop whic hdefines the step size thatwould solve the problem in 2 steps.

My solution: 

s = [1,2,3,4]
l = len(s)
new = []
o = [(s[i],s[i+1]) for i in range(0,len(s),2)]
for j in o:
    fir = j[0]
    sec = j[1]
    new.extend([sec]*fir)
print(new)

Better solution: Usage of step size 2 in the for loop and extend function as learned before.

class Solution:
    def decompressRLElist(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        for i in range(0,len(nums),2):
            result.extend([nums[i+1]]*nums[i])
        return result
