Shuffle an array:

New function: List.extend takes only one argument so you must create tuples and extend.

The difference between list. append and list.extend is that if you provide tuples as input argument to both, append will create a new array with sets of tuples of length i/2 and extend will create a new array of length i with each individual element and no tuples.
My solution: 

class Solution:
    def shuffle(self, nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
        new=[]
	
        for i in range(n):
            new.extend([nums[i],nums[n+i]])
        return new
