1281. Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer

Learning: convert string element to integer in order to multiply iteratively.

My solution:
class Solution:
    def subtractProductAndSum(self, n: int) -> int:
        prod = 1
        summ = 0
        new = str(n)
        for i in new:
            j = int(i)
            prod = prod*j
            summ = summ + j
        return prod-sum
        
Better solution:

Mine appears to be the better one . Key step: converting into int(i) forst and then solving instead of int(i) in each step or using shile loop and taking %10 and n//10
